Charitable – A Bloc Project

IOS APP DEVELOPMENT 
USER RESEARCH &  UI DESIGN
USER PERSONAS & USER FLOWS
LOW FIDELITY AND HIGH FIDELITY WIREFRAMING
INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPING

SUMMARY
Charitable is a web application I prototyped for a Bloc class project.
The goal is to design a web application for people to crowdfund donations for charities and foundations, and allow people to donate to specific causes. 

THE CHALLENGE
Charitable is the first app I have prototyped, and it challenged me to think about user processes in a new way. 
I was challenged to think two user groups: how a Fundraiser can to collect donations and meet goals, while sending out their information via email and social media; and how a donor can find a place to donate, through the purchasing and completion process. 

UI DESIGN
THE LOGO
I designed Charitable’s logo to include a ribbon in the title, to show a relation to charitable contributions. 
I used a lively and bright color palette.


SOLUTION
RESEARCH & USER TESTING

USER STORIES
As a fundraiser, I want to create an account
As a fundraiser, I want to display my progress of reaching my monthly and annual goals
As a fundraiser, I want to view a list of people who donated and how much they gave
As a fundraiser, I want to monitor comments on my fundraiser page
As a donor, I want to sign up for an account
As a donor, I want to browse local charities that I can donate to
As a donor, I want to donate
As a donor, I want to track my donations


USER FLOWS

SITE MAP

PROTOTYPING
I used Balsamiq to protoype my low fidelity wireframes for this project. 
I then designed the high fidelity wireframes using Sketch.

USER TESTING
I used InVision to test the Interactive Prototyping.  


RESULTS & CONCLUSION 
Although I ran out of time to code this project, this was a huge learning curve for me. I ended up with 48 screens on InVision.

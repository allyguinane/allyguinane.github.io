Treasurely – A Bloc Project

RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN 
USER RESEARCH &  UI DESIGN
LOW FIDELITY AND HIGH FIDELITY WIREFRAMING
INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPING

SUMMARY
The goal is to work with a new startup to develop a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create  documents, store images, bookmark links to websites, and collaborate with others with the app. 

THE CHALLENGE
My challenge was to create a different product than competitors, that may have similar features.  
In this project, I learned the fundamentals of user experience, inlcuding:  

User personas
User stories
User flows
Sitemap
Lo-fidelity wireframes
Responsive wireframes
High-fidelity mockups
Logo / branding
Style guide
Interactive prototype
HTML/CSS development
Usability Testing


UI DESIGN
THE LOGO
Treasurely’s logo shows a key, constructed from parts of the typeface xxx I used on the website. Tresurely’s motto is “Unlock Your Thoughts.  I used a jewel-toned color palette.


SOLUTION
RESEARCH & USER TESTING

PROTOTYPING
I used Balsamiq to protoype my low fidelity wireframes for this project. 
I then designed the high fidelity wireframes using Sketch.

USER TESTING
I used InVision to test the Interactive Prototyping.  Check out Treasurely on InVision: https://invis.io/YQ518WDT6

RESULTS & CONCLUSION 
I coded Treasurely using HTML and CSS.  View it on my Github: http://allyguinane.github.io/Treasurely/
